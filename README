This is a simple test harness.  It works in this fashion.

1.  It used capp to generate a CIB based application.
2.  The app loads Main.menu.cib.  
3.  It then alloc inits a TrFilterManager object
4.  The TrFilterManager loads FilterGenerator.cib
5.  The filter manager looks somewhat like a Mail.app rule dialog
6.  The scrollview in the middle is used to add TrFilterRule objects
7.  Clicking the + button adds a TrFilterRule
8.  TrFilterRule loads it's CIB file (FilterRule.cib)

There are two problems currently


1.  using a new nib2cib from tools downloaded and istalled yesterday fails. 
    Turning on the debug console will show that most of the controls come up
    as null, rather than the address of the control.

    So, in this case buttons don't work etc.  Strangely enough, an extra window 
    comes up (or diffeferent bridge window)


2.  The thing that is the stopper for me right now is the scroll view.  As TrFilterRule
    objects are added, they are added to the document view of the scroller.  The
    frame size is adjust to represent the new view added.  

    The scroller does indeed showup when enough filter rules are added, but the scrollers
    themselves dont work.  Clicking on the arrows does nothing.  You can click/drag the
    scroller, but the view doesn't scroll

NOTE:  I've tried two variants on the document view for the scroller, FYI.  

    1.  I created a regular NSView object in the IB, and set that as the document view within the app.
    2.  I used the custom view within the scrollview object as the document view.

    In both cases, I created an IBOUTLET named m_documentView.  I used IB to attach to either the
    separate NSView, or the NSView within the scrollview.

    Then, in the code, I do  [m_scroller setDocumentView: m_documentView]
